          'If you buy a comprehensive ticket, it will allow you not only to enter the castle, but you can climb up the stairs to a balcony which gives incredible views over the historical site of Khiva. It is best to go there at sunset time as the view is beautiful and there are great photo opportunities. Apart from this, the castle is big with different sections to explore. Two hours would be enough.',
